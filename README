We recently launched a Nepali Unicode – श्री. ‘श्री’ because it is the first project under fortystones lab and श्री गणेश!
means starting a new thing. This is our first of many to-be products at fortystones ;) .

<h2>Why did we built it?</h2>

We didn’t really enjoy going to other websites for occasional नेपाली typing. So, we thought why not build one platform
ourself huh? I talked about it with @rabi_shah for the first time and he was like – DUH! We then worked for a month 
and walllaa.. the idea turned into reality at fortystones lab. Proud moment for fortystones team.
